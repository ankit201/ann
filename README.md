ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK


An artificial neural network is an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in a brain. Here, each circular node represents an artificial neuron and an arrow represents a connection from the output of one artificial neuron to the input of another.
Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains. Such systems "learn" (i.e. progressively improve performance on) tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming. For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as "cat" or "no cat" and using the results to identify cats in other images. They do this without any a priori knowledge about cats, e.g., that they have fur, tails, whiskers and cat-like faces. Instead, they evolve their own set of relevant characteristics from the learning material that they process.


In this project we take a dataset Churning Models where we have information of customers of bank. The information is given by CustomerId, Surname, Credit Scpre,  Geography, Gender, Age, Tenure, Balance, Number of products, Has/Hasn't Credit Card, Estimated Salary and if he/she is an active member or not. We also have the information if the member is presently the customer of the bank or if he had already left the bank. 
We split the data into 80% as training set and 20% as testing set. Now we make our neural network and train it on the training set.
The testing set is made for predicting the results. Now we make a confusion matrix to analyze our result and get the accuracy.
